                <h3>What is it?</h3>
                ImmersivePoints is a web-application for virtual reality devices to explore 3D data in the most natural way possible. <br>
                To view the data you need to either attach a virtual reality device attached to your PC, or a stand-alone one, such as the oculus quest.

                <h3>Why was this created?</h3>
                About 5 years ago I was working an algorithm to cluster 3D brain data. It was hard to know whether the topological ordering made sense. The existing tools at the time were slow and uninformative, so I learned JavaScript to use a 3D visualisation library. That year <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v"=wZXjoMMigJU>Google launched the google-cardboard</a> which allowed me to look around in my visualisation. <br>
                Although this was impressive, you still could not move around freely. This year Facebook launched the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxrJ2L8Xl4">Oculus Quest</a>, which is an untethered virtual reality headset! I bought it and adjusted my old code to finally be able to walk around in the data like I wanted 5 years ago!<br>
                After a lot of positive feedback from others I also made an upload function, so you can look at your own data as well. Enjoy!
